# ResuMe

## Overview
ResuMe was built to provide a full-functioning template for customizable online resumes for small groups of people (C-suite, startup founders, family members). ResuMe was built using Ruby on Rails and uses fully unobtrusive JavaScript and AJAX for all content creation and editing. Unobtrusive client-slide JS is implemented using page-specific Garber-Irish implementation, allowing for graceful degradation of JS in unsupported browsers.
